## Features

1. Support fuzzy search broken header dex(deep search mode).
2. Compatible with all android version(frida supported).
3. One click installation, without modifying the system, easy to deploy and use.

## Installation

```
pip3 install frida-dexdump
```

## Usage

CLI arguments base on [frida-tools](https://github.com/frida/frida-tools), you can quickly dump the foreground application like this:

```
frida-dexdump -FU
```

Or specify and spawn app like this:

```
frida-dexdump -U -f com.app.pkgname
```

Additionally, you can see in `-h` that the new options provided by frida-dexdump are:

```
-o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT  Output folder path, default is './<appname>/', make sure this folder exists otherwise there will be error.
-d, --deep-search           Enable deep search mode.
--sleep SLEEP               Waiting times for start, spawn mode default is 5s.
```

When using, I suggest using the `-d, --deep-search` option, which may take more time, but the results will be more complete.
